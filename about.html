            <h1>Why should people donate blood?</h1>
            <p>Safe blood saves lives. Blood is needed by women with complications during pregnancy and childbirth,
                children with severe anaemia, often resulting from malaria or malnutrition, accident victims and
                surgical and cancer patients.<br>There is a constant need for a regular supply of blood because it can
                be stored only for a limited
                period of time before use. Regular blood donation by a sufficient number of healthy people is needed to
                ensure that blood will always be available whenever and wherever it is needed.<br>Blood is the most
                precious gift that anyone can give to another person – the gift of life. A decision to
                donate your blood can save a life, or even several if your blood is separated into its components – red
                cells, platelets and plasma – which can be used individually for patients with specific conditions.<br>
            </p>

            <h1>What happens when I give blood?</h1>
            <p>Whether you are a first-time or regular donor, the blood service must make sure that you will come to no
                harm by donating blood. This includes checking your blood to be sure it will be safe for the person who
                receives it.
